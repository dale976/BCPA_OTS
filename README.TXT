This is a partial implementation of an online ticketing system for the 
Bucks Center of Performing Arts.

Its purpose is to allow users to sign in, view and book a showing of an
event.

This partial system allows for user sign in, user registration, viewing 
a list of available events and shows the details for a particular event 
when selected.

All of this can be done through a user interface.

All of this combined illustrates the use of object oriented design in 
how this project has been put together.
